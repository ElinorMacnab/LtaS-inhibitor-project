# LtaS-inhibitor-project
Data and figures for my Part II research project characterising novel lipoteichoic acid synthase inhibitors with respect to their antibiotic action.

Most files are dated in the format dd-mm-yy (EMKM) or mm-dd-yy (XCW). DSF or LSI indicates differential scanning fluorimetry data. DRC indicates a dose-response curve. "t=x" means that the plate was read after approximately x hours' incubation.
